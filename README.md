# Finance_Bank_loan_project
Performed Data analysis on how banks issue loans to customers. 
Firstly, I analyzed the factors/ criteria banks use in assessing individuals as fit for loans. I analyzed the distribution of each feature and then explored the account holders’ distribution. 
Then I analyzed Income distribution and whether education impacts on availing loans or not. Lastly, I performed hypothesis testing to check whether the number of persons in the individual’s family has a significant impact on availing personal loans or not.
